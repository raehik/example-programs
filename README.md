Example programs & scripts
--------------------------

### python-small-program

Good for scripts/programs 100 lines to 1000. Main points:

  * handles CLI arguments
  * also handles "commands" as arguments (worth removing if not needed)
  * handles logging
  * does all this while being easy to convert to a library (CLI-related things
    are grouped and pointed out)

Not perfect, but highly flexible.
